ChatGPT
Creating an online banking system using Angular, ASP.NET Web API, and integrating AI can be a comprehensive project. Hereâ€™s a high-level roadmap to guide you through the process:

1. Project Setup
Frontend: Set up an Angular project.
Backend: Set up an ASP.NET Core Web API project.
AI Services: Decide on the AI services or libraries you want to use.
2. Core Banking Features
User Authentication: Implement secure user authentication (e.g., JWT tokens).
Account Management: CRUD operations for bank accounts.
Transactions: Implement functionalities for deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
Balance Inquiry: Allow users to check their account balance.
Transaction History: Provide a history of transactions.
3. AI Integration
Fraud Detection: Use AI to detect suspicious transactions.
Chatbot: Implement an AI-powered chatbot for customer support.
Personalized Insights: Provide users with insights and recommendations based on their transaction history.
4. Security Measures
Encryption: Ensure data is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Add an extra layer of security for user logins.
Regular Audits: Perform security audits and vulnerability assessments.
5. User Interface
Dashboard: Create a user-friendly dashboard to show account details and recent transactions.
Forms and Modals: Use Angular forms for user inputs like login, registration, and transactions.
Responsive Design: Ensure the application is mobile-friendly.
6. Testing
Unit Tests: Write unit tests for both frontend and backend.
Integration Tests: Ensure different parts of the system work together as expected.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Get feedback from potential users.
7. Deployment
CI/CD Pipeline: Set up continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines.
Hosting: Choose a cloud provider to host your application (e.g., Azure, AWS).
